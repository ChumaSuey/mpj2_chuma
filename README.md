### General Information / Behind the scenes.

I had a left over idea from a level design jam by Steve Lee that i didn't have time to participate, the jam was called Contrast and Brightness, where i had the idea to make a surrounded by sky map where brightness and darkness would switch in areas across the map to play with the Light entities.

Ever since i grew up as a mapper i realized that idea was not the best i could have done.

With a bit from that leftover and abandoned idea i decided to make this map, the brightness/contrast factor can be seen with my signature Neon Lights style.

The music track was one i requested to Proxy-MIDI because my original idea was an usual Dark Synthwave bumped up track, Proxy did a cool Synthwave style mockup, started from scratch since he didn't record the original and re-made it for my Aesthetic map, i thank him for that. (the song is the in-game version of it as an ogg file, there's a full version hoping Proxy can share it somewhere or i can share it somewhere).

Hope you enjoy my map! Shine with style!


### Special thanks

A special shoutout to Ribbiks and dannebubinga for making Sunlust (Doom wad) as it's aesthetic and a bit of difficulty dynamics have inspired my mapping skills in a sort of way. <3

A special tribute mention to my friend Meowgi from the Doom Community for helping me for mapping into doom, leading Pacifist Paradise community and never stopped believing in me.  <3
